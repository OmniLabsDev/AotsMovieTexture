AotsMovieTexture
================

Movie Texture in Unity has several drawbacks. One of the most important disadvantages
is the lack of capability to handle alpha channel.

This shader is a dumb workaround for it â€” place an image and an alpha mask side by side,
and then it composites them into an ARGB texture.
